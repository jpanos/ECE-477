	<b><u>About:</u></b>
My name is Jackie and I am a senior in electrical engineering.  I have a special interest in mmWave and signal processing. I am excited to do image processing in this project. I have accrued experience in systems engineering from my internships at Northrop Grumman Space Systems.  As well, I have built my skills in signal processing techniques by employing that knowledge in mmWave research. When I am not doing eletrical engineering stuff, I like to work out and eat.  You know, the finer things in life.
